#  📘 Project Report: Student Performance Analysis Using Power BI

##  📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes student performance to uncover insights into factors influencing academic success. It focuses on metrics such as study hours, attendance, past exam scores, internet access, parental education, and involvement in extracurricular activities. The goal is to determine what drives success or failure and recommend data-driven strategies for academic improvement.

##  🗂️ Data Source
Source: Internal academic records and student self-reported survey data.
Size: Medium-sized dataset (few hundred to thousand records).

##  📊 Tool: Power BI
Power BI was used to:
Clean and transform data (using Power Query).
Create interactive visualizations and dashboards.
Generate drill-down capabilities for detailed analysis.

##  ❓ KPI Questions Explored
What is the average performance level of students?
How many students pass vs fail?
Does studying more hours correlate with better scores?
Do students with higher attendance perform better?
Are there gender differences in academic outcomes?
Does internet access at home affect student outcomes?
What role does parental education play in student success?
How do extracurricular activities influence academic scores?


##  🔍 Findings
Pass Rate: 76% of students passed the final exam.

Average Final Score: 68.5/100.

Study Hours Impact: Strong positive correlation (r = 0.68) between study hours and final scores.

Attendance Influence: Students with >90% attendance had a 90% pass rate.

Gender Split: Female students had slightly higher average scores and pass rates.

Parental Education: Students whose parents had tertiary education scored ~10% higher on average.

Internet Access: Those with home internet performed better (avg. score 71 vs 62).

Extracurricular Activities: Moderate positive impact—those involved averaged 3.5 points higher.

##  ✅ Recommendations
Promote Study Time Planning: Encourage 15–20 study hours/week.

Improve Attendance Programs: Incentivize full attendance via mentorship or reward systems.

Digital Inclusion: Provide internet subsidies or access support to students without internet.

Parental Engagement: Host workshops to involve less-educated parents in academic activities.

Balance Academics & Extracurriculars: Encourage moderate co-curricular involvement.

Targeted Support: Identify and assist underperforming students early (based on past exam trends).

##   ⚠️ Limitations
Self-reported data bias: Some values (e.g., study hours) may be inaccurately reported.

Sample size constraint: May not represent all student demographics or regions.

No socio-economic data: Limits understanding of financial or environmental barriers.

Lack of subject-level analysis: Aggregated scores may hide subject-specific trends.

##  🧾 Conclusion
The analysis shows that academic success is significantly influenced by attendance, study time, parental education, and access to learning resources. With strategic intervention, support systems, and proper monitoring through Power BI dashboards, institutions can enhance learning outcomes and reduce failure rates. Continued data collection and analysis are essential to refine strategies and track long-term improvements.
